    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //call by value
    //宣告age與age2兩個記憶體位置 ,age2拷貝age的“值”
    //故當後續修改age為200時, age2值不會被改變 
    let age = 100;
    let age2 = age;
    console.log(age, age2);//100 ,100
    age = 200;
    console.log(age, age2);//200 , 100
    //字串相同
    let name = 'Wes'
    let name2 = name;
    console.log(name, name2);//wes wes
    name = 'wesley'
    console.log(name, name2);//wesley wes

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    //宣告變數team , 將陣列/物件/function賦值給team,此時會將該物件也給一個記憶體位置
    const team = players
    console.log(players, team);//['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'] ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy']

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //當修改陣列/物件/function時,等同於修改記憶體內的值 ,故team和players都會跟著更動
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    console.log(players, team);//['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Lux']

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();


    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread

    const team2 = [...players];
    team4[3] = 'wedkwjen';
    console.log(team4);

    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:

    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 12 });
    console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
